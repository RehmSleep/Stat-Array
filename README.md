# Stat-Array
MATLAB Code for optimizing Stat Array v1.1  for 5e DND character stats
The Array can be found at https://drive.google.com/open?id=1zXDdAmKhxDGl3x-zHvycHX9udPv2UxOi9bHPxXUs5tY

INSTRUCTIONS FOR USING THE ARRAY

Step 1: roll two six sided dice at the same time and record the sum. Example: 2+1=3 

Step 2: Repeat step one six time so that you have a roll for each stat. 

	Example:player 1 rolls 2d6 6 times and gets the following {3, 7, 8 , 11, 6, 8}

If you roll a "2" then you will need to roll a 20 sided dice and record that number with the corrisponding "2." 
	
	Example: Player 2 rolls 2 on one of his 2d6 and then rolls a d20 and gets a 16 so his die roll is 2(16).

Step 3: For each sum choose a column in the array to assign that sum to. 

	Example "I want to use the 10 I rolled on my 2d6 in Column G for a  17 as my starting stat score"

Step 4: Use each of the sums you rolled in a different column until you have used every column exactly one time. You can choose where you want to use each sum. 
	
	Example: (using the rolls in the example in step 2) "My stats are 16 [using an 8 in column G], 16 [using the 11 in Column F], 13 [using the 6 in Column E], 10 [using the 3 in Column D], 11 [using the 8 in Column C], and 8 [using the 7 in Column B], for a total of 74 when you add up all my scores"

If you have a two you can use it in any column but you can still only have one stat from each column. 
	
	Example: Player 2 might say the following if their rolls were {4, 8, 2(16), 11, 11, 9} "using a 2(16) I can get a 14 for my stat in Column E so I'm going to use it there and use this extra 11 I rolled in D so that my stats are 16[from 8], 16[11], 14[2(16)], 13[11], 9[4], and 9[9] for a total of 77. Wow, I got lucky with that d20 on my 2 and it actually helped my stats out." 
	Player 2 could also assign their scores 17[11], 16[11], 12[4], 12[8], 11[2(16)], 9[9]. Which would also net them a total of 77.


The blue space in the blue and yellow section below the Array can be edited by typing die rolls in column A to reference and then using the dropdowns in columns B through G to play with where to put those die rolls



The optimizer only works with up to one rolled 2 in a set of 6 rolls of the 2d6
